With a mighty leap, which caused Mahendra Hill to tremble in its depths and terrified all the creatures living on its slopes, the monkey Hanuman rose into the air and flew across the ocean. After a flight of four days, during which he had many adventures and performed miracles, he finally reached Lanka. From a hill, he surveyed the town, which seemed to him almost impregnable. He made himself as small as a cat, and after sunset, crept into the town. He examined the whole city, the palace of Ravana, and the wonderful chariot called Pushpaka, on which the demon-king used to drive through the air. He also penetrated into Ravanaâ€™s harem, where he saw the king reposing in the midst of his beautiful women. After a long search, he at last found Sita, wasted by grief, in an Ashoka-tree grove. He makes himself known as a friend and messenger of Rama. She tells him that Ravana has threatened to devour her after two months, and that she will die if Rama does not rescue her before then. Hanuman assures her that Rama will certainly save her. Then he returns to the hill, flies back across the ocean and recounts everything to the monkeys awaiting him there. Finally, he returns to Rama, bringing him the news and a message from his beloved.
