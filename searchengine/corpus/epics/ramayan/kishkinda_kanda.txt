The brothers reach Lake Pampa, when Rama sinks into a melancholy funk. It is spring, and the awakening of nature — the calling birds, the blooming trees — arouses in him a longing for his distant loved one. But they soon meet the monkey-king Sugriva. He tells them that be has been robbed of his wife and his dominion by his brother Valin, who has driven him from his own kingdom. Rama and Sugriva now form a close bond of friendship. Rama promises to support Sugriva against Valin, while Sugriva promises to aid Rama in recovering Sita. Before Kishkindha, the residence of Valin, the brothers’ monkey armies meet in battle. Rama comes to Sugriva’s aid and kills Valin. Sugriva is consecrated as king, and Angada, the son of Valin, as heir to the throne.
Among the counselors of Sugriva, Hanuman, the son of the wind-god, is the wisest. Sugriva has the greatest confidence in him, and commissions him to find Sita. Accompanied by a host of monkeys under the leadership of Angada, the resourceful Hanuman sets out toward the south. After many adventures they meet Sampati, a brother of the vulture Jatayus, who tells them how he had flown in a race with his brother, and had scorched his wings. Since then, he had been lying helpless in the Vindhya hills, but be has seen Ravana carrying Sita away to Lanka. He described to them where Lanka was located, and the monkeys set out for the coast. But when they saw the limitless, billowing sea before them, they despaired of getting across it. Angada, however, advises them: “Do not despair, for despair destroys a man as an angry snake kills a child.” After much discussion, it is decided that no one can jump so far as Hanuman can. He then climbs to the top of Mount Mahendra, and prepares to leap across the ocean.
